Why you don't use diffusion model for time series forecasting?
[[id:9e24b9b6-733f-4638-825f-9e8b1b4203f9][Diffusion]]

* Diffusion model

- Informer
- Autoformer
- Transformer MAF
- Generative Time Series for (NeurIPS)

  Bad results depending on the time scale

  Generative TS forecasting with diffusion denoise, and disentanglement -> good
  in short term

  Diffusion, sample 100 noise
  Change the noise different result

  Time steps x Diffusion steps x Distribution samplings



* Questions
- Images as signals?
